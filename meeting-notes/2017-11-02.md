## Ideas
### Build basic feature extractors

- goal: deploy Leo's, Basak's and Jun's model to Kipoi
- start a new python library - gfeat - genomic feature extractors 
  - talk to Jun
	- put everything to python
  - define the gene class, etc etc
  - work on one gene at the time basis
	- gene/transcript feature extractor
    - exon feature extractor...
    - Gene
      - Transcript
		- Exons
        - 3'UTR
        - 5'UTR
- use dask to build-up a DAG
  - come extractors depend on other extractors 
  - DAG computation & cache-ing figured out in the background
- define the basic API of a feature extractor
  - check Facebook's ML platform - how to define the basic feature extractors

#### TODO
- [ ] write down the feature list
  - [ ] setup a gfeat (or pycis) package
  - [ ] alone - Jun's paper
    - for each feature, list the dependencies
      - make it nicely in a markdown (make it readable)
		- `notes/first_sketch/dependencies.md`
    - try to picture a DAG and identify core components
      - put to notes/ document
		- `notes/first_sketch/DAG.jpeg`
      - update `notes/first_sketch/dependencies.md`
    - can you come up with basic building blocks / abstractios?
	- check also the code
  - [ ] talk to Basak about her features
	- what is extra to Jun?
- [ ] establish an early end-to-end pipeline
  - define the end-user API
	- write down a few user-stories
    - it would somehow match the tf.Estimator API (of defined features)
  - write the first feature extractors yourself
  - unit-testing
  - CLI
  - class definitions
